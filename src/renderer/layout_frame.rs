///   quantum, then applies these paragraph margins.
/// - [`ParagraphBox::content`] belongs to a flow that has no column of its own —
///   a table cell, a footnote, a header, a caption, a text box. Its origin is
///   that flow's own left edge. Its width was already resolved by that owner,
///   so the body column solver must not touch it.
